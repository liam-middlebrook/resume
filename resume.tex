\section{Selected Projects}

{\textbf{\emph{Splattershmup}}} - Lead Effects Programmer\\
Splattershmup is a Shoot 'Em Up game built in Unity3D. In Splattershmup the player leaves
a trail of paint as they play resulting in images that resemble Jackson Pollock's paintings.
I designed and implemented the paint system.

{\textbf{\emph{OfCourse}}} - Contributor\\
OfCourse is a course website framework that was written in Python using the Flask library.
OfCourse is currently being used in \href{http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com}{RIT's Humanitarian
Free and Open Source Software Culture Course}. OfCourse is part of the FOSS@RIT
program which is sponsored by RedHat.\\

{\textbf{\emph{MINX}}} - Lead Developer\\
MINX is a C++ Game Development Framework. MINX makes it easier to create 2D games in C++ using an API
that is similar to Microsoft's XNA Framework. MINX currently runs on Windows and Linux. I created the
graphical backend for MINX and designed the API endpoints.\\

{\textbf{\emph{OpenGL Water Demo}}} - Creator\\
A demo written in C++ and OpenGL that renders water. The waves are based off of scrolling displacement
map textures. The demo includes a photo of pebbles with refraction to better demonstrate the effect
of the waves. The water in this demo is looks best when used as a background detail or with a minimal
wave amplitude.\\

{\textbf{\emph{Russian Chicken Inspector}}} - Creator\\
Russian Chicken Inspector is a game created during Global Game Jam 2014. In Russian Chicken Inspector
you go around the world with the goal of collecting as many eggs as possible. All of the textures used
in Russian Chicken Inspector are procedurally generated on runtime.\\

\section{Work Experience}

{\textbf{\emph{MAGIC Research Fellow}}} \hfill March 2014 - Present\\
Worked on \href{https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/blockytalky.git}{BlockyTalky}. I implmented
the Servo Motor Block and assisted in implementing an interface for remotely controlling the 
BlockyTalky through a webapp.

{\textbf{\emph{Kids On Campus Instructor}}} \hfill July 2014 - August 2014\\
Worked with students from grades 9 - 12. Over the course of two weeks each session of campers
learned how to use the Unity3D engine. The campers were taught how to create scripts for Unity
in C\#.

{\textbf{\emph{Kids On Campus Assistant Instructor}}} \hfill July 2012 - August 2013\\
Assisted in teaching students from grades 9 - 12 how to create games. They used Microsoft's 
XNA Framework in C\# and learned about different Object Oriented Programming Concepts.
